# PCA and Clustering Analyses of US Arrests

## Dataset
This dataset contains arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each US state in 1973. It also gives the percent of the population living in urban areas.
In this project, I will explore the data, use PCA to reduce the amount dimensions, and perform unsupervised learning techniques on the data.

## Installation
This project requires python and the following libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

To use this project first clone the repo on your device using the command:
```
git init
git clone https://github.com/MingHuanGit/PCA-and-Clustering-Analyses-of-US-Arrests.git
```

## Usage
Use this code to help you learn techniques in EDA, PCA, hierarchical clustering, and KMeans clustering and how to implement these using Python.
